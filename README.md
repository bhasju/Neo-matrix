# Neo-matrix

We get that github is full of people making some awesome matrix rain sequences, but this one is slightly unique.

This one tries to simulate the vision Neo gets after waking up after being shot by the agents.

What we were able to get with our feeble skills at opencv is a watered down, very slow code, which stops working entirely if ou try to save the video.

Take a look.
Bit please don't laugh.
